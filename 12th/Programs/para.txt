Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft said they will use AMD’s newest AI chip,
the Instinct MI300X — a sign that tech companies want alternatives to the expensive
Nvidia graphics processors that have been essential for artificial intelligence.
If the MI300X is good enough and inexpensive enough when it starts shipping early
next year, it could lower costs for developing AI models. AMD CEO Lisa Su projected
the market for AI chips will amount to $400 billion or more in 2027, and she said
she hopes AMD has a sizable part of that market.
